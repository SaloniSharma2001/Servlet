# Servlet

**Setup Server**
JDK + Eclipse + Tomcat Server Download.

In Eclipse, Window >> Show View >> Servers >> Add new server >> Select type of server (Apache) >> Select Tomcat Version >> Setup Tomcat Installation directory >> Finish.
In server we can start and stop the server from Servers tab.

Now we can setup project in Eclipse in various ways. For example: Maven Project or Dynamic Web Project.
The advantage of Maven project setup is we don't have to manage manually jar files unlike Dynamic Web Projects.
